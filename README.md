## Cancer Neuroblastoma Tumor 3D Visualization

AI-driven solution for 3D visualization of pediatric neuroblastoma tumors. This technology can be further integrated into iOS and Android applications, as well as medical imaging systems such as MRI, MIBG, CT, and PET scanners. Additionally, it provides a foundation for developing dedicated hardware solutions using VHDL/Verilog for specialized medical devices. 

# MRI Tumor Segmentation and 3D Visualization

## Goal:

To develop a Python-based pipeline that segments a tumor from a 2D MRI slice, synthesizes a 3D tumor volume for visualization, calculates quantitative tumor metrics, and provides an AI model template for tumor staging classification.

## Design Overview:

* Loads and preprocesses a 2D MRI slice.
* Segments tumor region automatically using Otsu thresholding and morphological cleanup.
* Creates a synthetic 3D tumor volume by extruding the segmented mask.
* Calculates tumor volume and maximum diameter from the 3D volume.
* Generates an interactive 3D volume rendering with rotation and color mapping.
* Provides a convolutional neural network template for future tumor stage classification model training.
* Designed for execution in Python environments such as Google Colab.

## Real-Life Impact and Scope:

* Supports medical decision makers by providing quantitative tumor metrics and enhanced 3D visualization, aiding surgical planning and treatment monitoring.
* Can be integrated with multi-modal imaging (MIBG, MRI, CT, PET scans) to accelerate diagnosis, reduce delays, and optimize healthcare resource usage.
* Benefits patients via improved diagnosis, personalized treatment, and better communication of tumor status.
* Advances research by facilitating dataset preparation, benchmarking AI models, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Steps Performed:

1. Upload a 2D MRI image (e.g., `MRI_image.png`) into the environment.
2. Load and normalize the image to grayscale.
3. Segment tumor using Otsu thresholding and morphological operations.
4. Generate a synthetic 3D volume by extruding the tumor mask with smooth edges.
5. Calculate tumor volume (in voxel units) and maximum diameter.
6. Visualize the tumor volume interactively with 3D rotation and volume rendering.
7. Use the AI model template to train tumor staging classifiers when labeled datasets become available.

## Results:

* Successfully segmented tumor from 2D MRI slice.
* Created synthetic 3D volume representing tumor morphology.
* Computed tumor volume and diameter metrics important for clinical assessment.
* Rendered interactive 3D visualizations with color mapping and rotation controls.
* Established AI model architecture for future tumor staging prediction.

## Notes & Limitations:

* 3D volume is synthetically generated by extrusion of a single 2D slice, not real 3D imaging data.
* Tumor stage, age, and surgical resectability cannot be reliably predicted without additional clinical data.
* AI model requires labeled data for training and validation.
* Always consult clinical professionals for diagnosis and treatment decisions.
